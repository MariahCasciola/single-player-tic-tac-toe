# Plans and Ideas

## Breaking down logic

+ Pressing Start chooses if the player is "X" or "O".

+ Program will place an letter in a random blank spot.

+ Program waits for single-player to select start.

+ Check for win conditions.

+ There are 8 combinations for three in a row.

+ Check for lose conditions.

+ Such as no three in a row.

+ All 9 spots have been filled without three in a row.

+ Restart/New Game button renders with a win or a loss.
(Oho, ho, three in a row)

## Completed Tasks

+ Pressing start will choose who is "X" and "O" at random.

+ The program plays against a human player by placing "X" or "O" at random.

+ Cells are disabled after a win or a cat game.

## Pending Tasks

+ Create toggle for START/NEW GAME, so the user can trigger the board clear.

+ Cells are disabled until the player clicks start or new game.

+ X must go first instead of player going first every game.

+ Create a program that plays to win.

+ Create a better grid for the cells.

+ Create hover effect for player's next move.

+ Optional, but very desired: Render a little cat when there is a cat game.
