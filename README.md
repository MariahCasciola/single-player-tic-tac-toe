# Single Player Tic Tac Toe

This game will strategically play tic-tac-toe against a human player.

Once a player clicks on a cell, the program will place it's piece on the board.

There are two modes

Easy and hard.

My grandma had no faith in her ability to play my tic-tac-toe game because she was afraid a computer would be too smart for her.

She has a really hard time pushing buttons on a touch screen.

I got to tell her that the computer will play only as smart as I make it.

She was really happy that she won her first game of tic-tac-toe against a computer.
